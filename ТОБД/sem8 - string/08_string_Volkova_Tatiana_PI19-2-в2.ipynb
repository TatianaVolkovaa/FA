Also, once the strawberries cook down, I use a potato masher to break them up a bit more and I like that consistency.  The black pepper kick in this jam is really fun, and it's great on toasted English muffins, as well as on peanut butter & jelly sandwiches (made with whole wheat bread.)

I took semi frozen chicken breasts, browned them, then added the vinegar and chicken stock to cook them the rest of the way through at a simmer. I did omit the sugar to avoid the sugary-ness some reviewers commented on and it was PERFECT. As for the couscous I didn't really change anything, except I used cold broth and let it soak because I had the time to wait for the frozen chicken breasts to cook.

I think I bought one every day!  The first batch I made using this recipe was good but with the changes I made it is like I remember them.  First off, I did not change the amount of butter or sugar, but I did increase the peanut butter and corn syrup by 1/3 cup each and mixed with 8 cups of crispies.  Then I put it in a pan greased with some of the peanut oil on top of the peanut butter.  (I use only natural chunky peanut butter - don't want any more sugar or hydrogenated anything!)  These turned out great.  I just sent some of these sealed in seal-a-meal to Iraq.  Thanks for the great recipe!\": 172,\n",

The glaze is TDF good, a fudgy smooth consistency, and even DH who doesn\\'t like coconut thought the shredded coconut on top was perfect. So, for taste we all would agree on a definite 5 stars. :) My concern is that the recipe could benefit from some modifications & clarifications. The first thing I would want to point out is that the recipe as printed doesn\\'t make just \"large\" cupcakes. It will make JUMBO cupcakes. I don\\'t have a jumbo pan so I would have cut the recipe down had I known before hand. Instead I ended up making 36 regular sized cupcakes & because they had to be cooled in the pan before removing to wire rack (& because of the cakes\\' texture, this was in fact necessary) it took 3 hours just to bake all 36 cakes (2 days from start to finish). As far as the recipe, I think there is much too much butter. So much that the muffin tins felt as if I\\'d greased them before putting the paper liners in, but I didn\\'t. I also think the amount of sugar called for is overkill. They didn\\'t taste overly sweet, but the tops of the cakes are nearly caramelized. The butter sank to the bottom & made the cake greasy while the sugar floated to the top & turned into a sticky candy coating. Removing the cakes from the pan &/or removing the paper liners without tearing the entire top of the cake was a very slow & tedious process. I did enough to get a satisfactory photo but will just let everyone remove their own now. :) Again, this recipe is worth the effort in flavor & we would give 5 stars for that. Thanks for sharing, my3bb! Made for ZWT5-Ali Baba\\'s Babes.  UPDATE:  It\\'s been 4 days since I made these & they\\'ve been sitting out on the counter the whole time (not covered or sealed).  I just finished eating one & cannot believe that it\\'s still SO GOOD!  They\\'re not greasy anymore & still aren\\'t dried out.  The cake is still moist & only just approaching the \"day old\" stage around the top edge that isn\\'t in paper or covered in frosting.  The frosting is like biting into a rich, creamy fudge & was such a nice surprise.

The first test batch was less than impressive, the wonton wrappers were a dry/crisp and dull, so after asking-used a very light brush of oil and a pinch of salt made them soft and inviting(can also use cooking oil spray). I found the spice level/combination very agreeable but felt it was repetitious(maybe because of the turkey being less powerful than beef) and in need something. I noticed other people use rasins or sultanas so I chopped some for a second test batch--yummy! They added a needed contrast for my liking and the taste was complete. I wanted to give 5 stars but I've never had Samosas before so I can't say how traditional these taste.\\r\\nAs far as quantity,I made 12-15 filled wonton wraps and filled a small burrito wrap for neighbor to munch on and still had about 3/4 of the mixture remaining (in the fridge for tommorow) so I'd say #60 individual peices easily. This is a great filling to make ahead or freeze for time saving convenience.\\r\\nThumbs up!\": 271,\n",

I like the texture this way, and so did DH.  He actually thought it should be a bit thicker, which I may accomplish next time by adding a little flour between steps one and two.  My only issue, and it's a minor one, was the balance of flavor between the corn and the onion.  I thought the onion was a little strong, so next time I think I'll either use a little less, or use a sweet onion instead of the plain yellow onion that I used this time.

I always approach kugel recipes as fair game: an opportunity to vary what I throw in and what I omit according to the whim of the moment.  It was a while since I'd made kugel so I approached making this dish with considerable enthusiasm.  I made a few changes because of personal taste preferences and a few additions because I love the additional ingredients.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and used only 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce (we have almost zero tolerance of anything hot and spicy), I doubled the garlic and I added an onion and one leek: just love the combination of onions, garlic and leek.  I also added a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms.  I added basil and oregano (as in the ingredients list) but also added rosemary, sage and thyme. I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat sour cream as I find that low-fat versions of these makes no appreciable difference to the final dish.  Once all the ingredients had been combined, I added two eggs - as eggs have featured in most other kugel recipes I've made.

Next time I may make a sauce with fresh raspberries or strawberries.  It would be great to change up the berries or do some combinations.  Mine came out bar-like, not cake like, which I liked.  I didn't stir them too much, just mixed to incorporate the ingredients, but didn't beat to death.  We will have these again, and from the thumbs up from my company it may be sooner than I think!  Thanks and good luck with the contest!\": 155,\n",
       " 'Quick, easy, and very tasty---my favorite combo.  Also loved the spiciness.  Most of all loved the ease of the crust and the potential for variations.  Thanks for posting.': 36,\n",
       " 'We have all been sick with the &quot;crud&quot; and in need of good comfort food. This was the answer. Super easy to put together, and sooo delicious. Served with mashed potatoes with that incredible gravy. Thanks for sharing what is sure to become a regular at our house.': 60,\n",

       " 'This is the best dressing in the world!!  Thank you so much.': 15,\n",
       " 'Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written and we all loved it. It was so fresh tasting. Made for Spring PAC 2011.': 32,\n",
       " 'Too Good!!  I\\'m still dreaming about these nummies.  Had only made cake donuts before, never yeast. My youngest had commented recently how he\\'d really like to try one of those \"Krispy Kreme\" donuts everyone on TV is always talking about (they are no Krispy Kremes here in Alaska).  We tried this recipe with wonderful results!!  Made the entire batch and then froze half of them in a big ziplock bag. I recommend freezing..they were great thawed by popping them in the microwave to gently warm.  \\r\\nWe discovered it is best to wait until the donuts are almost cool to dip in the glaze. Otherwise the glaze isn\\'t quite thick enough. Next time we\\'ll try maple favoring etc, just for fun. \\r\\nI found cooking them at 365 for the full 2 minutes a side was fine, but they got a little over brown, so I shortened it up a bit. It isn\\'t the recipe, but how big you cut each donut..mine must have been on the small side.  \\r\\n Thank you Lorri, we\\'ll be making these way too often (g)': 210,\n",
